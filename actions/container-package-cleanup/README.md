# ðŸš€ Container Package Cleanup Action

This **Container Package Cleanup** GitHub Action automates the cleanup of old Docker images (or other container packages) in a GitHub repository or organization based on specified criteria.

## Features

- Deletes old container package versions based on a threshold date.
- Supports filtering by included and excluded tags.
- Allows configuration through inputs or a configuration file.
- Provides debug mode for detailed logging.
- Supports dry-run mode to preview deletions without making changes.

### Action Result

The primary result of this action is the deletion of old container package versions based on the specified criteria. The action logs detailed information about the cleanup process, including the packages and versions that were deleted or would be deleted in dry-run mode.

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `threshold-days`   | The number of days to keep container package versions. Older versions will be deleted. | No       | `7`                         |
| `included-tags`    | A comma-separated list of tags to include for deletion. Wildcards (`*`) are supported. | No       | `""` (all tags included)     |
| `excluded-tags`    | A comma-separated list of tags to exclude from deletion. Wildcards (`*`) are supported.| No       | `""` (no tags excluded)                  |
| `config-file-path` | The path to the configuration file. `NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS MOMENT`          | No       | `.github/package-cleanup.yml` |
| `dry-run`          | Enable dry-run mode to preview deletions without making changes.            | No       | `false`                     |

## ðŸ“Œ Outputs

This action does not produce any outputs. It performs cleanup operations directly on the container packages.

## Environment Variables

| Name            | Description                                      | Required |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `PACKAGE_TOKEN` | GitHub token with permissions to manage packages | Yes      |

> **Note:** The `PACKAGE_TOKEN` must have the following permissions:
> - **`read:packages`**: To list and retrieve package information.
> - **`delete:packages`**: To delete package versions.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Cleanup Old Docker Images

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Runs weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      threshold-days:
        description: "Number of days to keep container versions"
        required: false
        default: "7"
      included-tags:
        description: "Tags to include for deletion"
        required: false
        default: ""
      excluded-tags:
        description: "Tags to exclude from deletion"
        required: false
        default: "release*"
      dry-run:
        description: "Enable dry-run mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Container Package Cleanup Action
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/container-package-cleanup@main
        with:
          threshold-days: ${{ github.event.inputs.threshold-days }}
          included-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.included-tags }}
          excluded-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.excluded-tags }}
          debug: ${{ github.event.inputs.debug }}
          dry-run: ${{ github.event.inputs.dry-run }}
        env:
          PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
```

## Configuration File `NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS MOMENT`

The configuration file (e.g., `.github/package-cleanup.yml`) can be used to define the cleanup criteria. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
threshold-days: 7
included-tags:
  - latest
  - stable
excluded-tags:
  - release*
  - protected*
```

In this example:

- **Threshold Days:** Deletes versions older than 30 days.
- **Included Tags:** Only versions with the tags `latest` or `stable` will be considered for deletion.
- **Excluded Tags:** Versions with tags matching `release*` or `protected*` will be skipped.

## Additional Information

### Debug Mode

When `debug` is set to `true`, the action logs detailed information, including:

- The calculated threshold date.
- The list of excluded and included tags.
- The list of packages and their versions retrieved from the repository or organization.
- The versions that are selected for deletion after applying the filtering criteria.

This mode is useful for troubleshooting and understanding how the action processes packages and versions.

### Dry-Run Mode

When `dry-run` is set to `true`, the action will simulate the cleanup process without actually deleting any package versions. It will log the versions that would be deleted if the action were run without `dry-run`.

This mode is useful for previewing the cleanup results and ensuring the filtering criteria are correct before making changes.

### Priority of Tag Filtering

1. **Excluded Tags**:
   - Versions with tags matching `excluded-tags` are **always skipped**, even if they match `included-tags`.
2. **Included Tags**:
   - If specified, only versions with tags matching `included-tags` are considered for deletion.
3. **Default Behavior**:
   - If `included-tags` is empty, all versions (except those excluded) are considered for deletion.

### Tag Matching Behavior

- **Exact Match**: If a tag is specified without a wildcard (e.g., `release`), the action will look for an exact match. Only versions with the tag `release` will be included or excluded.
- **Wildcard Match**: If a tag is specified with a wildcard (e.g., `release*`), the action will look for partial matches. For example, `release*` will match tags like `release`, `release-v1`, or `release-candidate`.

This allows for flexible filtering based on your tagging strategy.
